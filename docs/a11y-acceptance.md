# Accessibility Acceptance Criteria (WCAG 2.2 AA intent)
**Version:** 2025-10-06

- Keyboard‑only flow: logical tab order; visible focus; skip‑link lands on `<main>`.
- Headings form a meaningful outline; landmarks used correctly.
- Images: meaningful `alt` text; decorative images `alt=""` and `aria-hidden="true"`.
- Forms: labels tied to inputs; error messages announced; success state obvious.
- Motion: `prefers-reduced-motion` respected; no essential info lost.
- Contrast: text and UI components meet contrast thresholds.
- Tests: run axe; no critical/serious issues remain.
